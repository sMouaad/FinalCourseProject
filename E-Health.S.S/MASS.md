# Research Article Summary The MASS App for Schizophrenia

## Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness impacting social functioning. Social skills training interventions have proven effective but are often challenging to access. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the MASS (Mobile Assessment and Social Skills Training) app in improving social functioning for individuals with schizophrenia.

## Methods

- **Design**: Pilot randomized controlled trial
- **Participants**: 30 (15 MASS group, 15 control group)
- Intervention MASS group used the app for 12 weeks; control group received standard treatment.
- **Outcome Measures**: 
  - **Primary**: Social functioning (SFS)
  - **Secondary**: Negative symptoms (PANSS-N), quality of life (QoL), app engagement (EMA)

## Results

- MASS group showed significant improvement in social functioning (SFS) compared to the control group after 12 weeks, sustained at 3 months follow-up.
- Trend towards improvement in negative symptoms (PANSS-N) and quality of life (QoL) in the MASS group.
- High app engagement 80% used the app at least 3 times per week.

## Conclusions

The MASS app appears promising for enhancing social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia. Larger and longer-term studies are needed for validation.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (30 participants)
- Lack of an active control group
- Relatively short intervention duration (12 weeks)

## Implications for Practice

The MASS app could be an adjunctive tool for improving social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia. Further research in real-world clinical settings is needed to determine effectiveness.
