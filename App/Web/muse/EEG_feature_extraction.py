Returns a number of feature vectors from a labeled CSV file, and a CSV header

def generate_feature_vectors_from_samples(matrix, nsamples, period,
										  remove_redundant = True):
	"""
	Reads data from CSV file in "file_path" and extracts statistical features 
	for each time window of width "period". 
	
	Details:
	Successive time windows overlap by period / 2. All signals are resampled to 
	"nsample" points to maintain consistency. Notice that the removal of 
	redundant features (regulated by "remove_redundant") is based on the 
	feature names - therefore, if the names output by the other functions in 
	this script are changed this routine needs to be revised. 
	
	Currently the redundant features removed from the lag window are, 
	for i in [0, nsignals-1]:
		- mean_q3_i,
		- mean_q4_i, 
		- mean_d_q3q4_i,
		- max_q3_i,
		- max_q4_i, 
		- max_d_q3q4_i,
		- min_q3_i,
		- min_q4_i, 
		- min_d_q3q4_i.
	
	Parameters:
		file_path (str): file path to the CSV file containing the records
		nsamples (int): number of samples to use for each time window. The 
		signals are down/upsampled to nsamples
		period (float): desired width of the time windows, in seconds
		state(str/int/float): label to attribute to the feature vectors
 		remove_redundant (bool): Should redundant features be removed from the 
	    resulting feature vectors (redundant features are those that are 
	    repeated due to the 1/2 period overlap between consecutive windows).
		cols_to_ignore (array): array of columns to ignore from the input matrix
		 
		
	Returns:
		numpy.ndarray: 2D array containing features as columns and time windows 
		as rows.
		list: list containing the feature names

Other notes by [fcampelo]:
1) ENTROPY
Entropy does not make sense for the "continuous" distribution of 
signal values. The closest analogue, Shannon's differential entropy, 
has been shown to be incorrect from a mathematical perspective
(see, https://www.crmarsh.com/static/pdf/Charles_Marsh_Continuous_Entropy.pdf
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_density_of_discrete_points )
I could not find an easy way to implement the LDDP here, nor any ready-to-use 
function, so I'm leaving entropy out of the features for now.
A possible alternative would be to calculate the entropy of a histogram of each 
signal. Also something to discuss.

2) CORRELATION
The way the correlations were calculated in the previous script didn't make 
much sense. What was being done was calculating the correlations of 75 pairs of 
vectors, each composed of a single observation of the 5 signals. I cannot think 
of any reason why this would be interesting, or carry any useful information
(simply because the first sample of h1 should be no more related to the first 
sample of h2 than it would be to the one immediately after - or before - it).
A (possibly) more useful information would be the correlations of each of the 
5 signals against each other (maybe they can be correlated under some mental 
states and decorrelated for others)? This is already done by the covariance 
matrix.

3) AUTOCORRELATION
A possibility would be to use the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of 
the signals. Both can be easily calculated, but would result in a massive 
amount of features (e.g., full autocorrelation would yield 2N-1 features per 
signal.). Not sure if we want that, but it's something to consider.

4) TSFRESH
Package tsfresh seemingly has a load of features implemented for time series,
it may be worth exploring.
