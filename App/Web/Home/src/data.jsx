        "Learn Communication Skills\nA decade-and-a-half later, with the rise of social media networking and texting, communication is becoming more casual, even in situations where more formal ways of communicating are required. What this means is that people from the younger generation, may not know or even understand the importance of effective communication skills in the workplace. When you take a look at the greatest leaders, one of the traits they possess, is the ability to communicate effectively, which underscores the importance of communication skills.\nAlpha Z Studio provides you communication skills app in which you will learn how to communicate with people in a good way. More details are given below. \n\ntypes of communication\nYour communication skills will fall under four categories of communication. Let's take a closer look at each area. \n\n1. Written communication\nWriting is one of the more traditional aspects of communication. We often write as part of our job, communicating via email and messenger apps like Slack, as well as in more formal documents, like project reports and white papers.\n\nConveying information clearly, concisely, and with an accurate tone of voice are all important parts of written communication.\n\n2. Verbal communication\nCommunicating verbally is how many of us share information in the workplace. This can be informal, such as chatting with coworkers about an upcoming deliverable, or more formal, such as meeting with your manager to discuss your performance.\n\n3. Non-verbal communication\nThe messages you communicate to others can also take place non-verbally—through your body language, eye contact, and overall demeanor. You can cultivate strong non-verbal communication by using appropriate facial expressions, nodding, and making good eye contact. Really, verbal communication and body language must be in sync to convey a message clearly.  \n\n4. Visual communication\nLastly, visual communication means using images, graphs, charts, and other non-written means to share information.

This is the unlimited, ad-free, version of the hit brain training app.  Mind Games is a great collection of games based in part on principles derived from cognitive tasks to help you practice different mental skills.  This app includes all of Mindware’s brain exercising games.  All games include your score history and graphs of your progress.  The main app shows a summary of your best games and today’s scores on all games.  Using some principles of standardized testing, your scores are also converted to a comparison scale so that you can see where you need work and excel.  The Training Center selects games for you to play in order to maximize your progress and enjoyment.  \n\nMind Games incorporates Mindfulness exercises.  Previous research has shown that Mindfulness may provide improvements in focus, working memory, and mental flexibility for some.  Research indicates that there may also be emotional benefits of Mindfulness.  The app  provides instruction on how to use Mindfulness during game play and in your life.  Other activities are recommended that previous research suggests may help cognition for some  (such as aerobic exercise).  You may also learn new memory strategies.  No scientific research has yet been conducted to determine if the app’s particular implementation of Mindfulness and brain training games has cognitive benefits.  At a minimum you can have fun challenging your mind with our games, learning a new meditation practice, learning about strategies that may enhance your retention of information, and gaining knowledge in the knowledge-based activities.",
