          The Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) is a tool
          used to assist the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in adults.
          It's designed to measure the presence and severity of autism-related
          symptoms. This self-test provides a preliminary measure and is not
          intended as a diagnostic tool.
